\section{Onsets}
Glides are treated as special onsets in most Romanization of Cantonese including Jyutping. Thus, I followed the tradition in the SubGlyph system of Cantonese as well. \par

\section{Tones}
In SubGlyphs, coda p, t and k are treated as the checked tone form of m, n and ng. Please switch checked tone labeled as 1, 3 and 6 in Jyutping to 7, 8 and 9 manually while using The {\textbackslash}ToSubGlyphs command. \par
The 8th tone is lower yin checked tone. I used expanded checked tone to describe it. \par
